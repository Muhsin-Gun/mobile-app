# SECTION 1: SNIPER ENTRIES - COMPLETE MASTER CLASS

## What is a Sniper Entry?

A **sniper entry** is an ultra-precise, high-probability entry into a trade where you wait for MULTIPLE CONFLUENCE FACTORS to align before executing. Instead of entering early, you wait for the PERFECT setup. This approach prioritizes QUALITY over QUANTITY.

**Sniper Entry Philosophy**:
- Wait for price to return to a confluence zone (multiple factors overlapping)
- Enter with a very tight stop-loss (minimal risk)
- Achieve high win rates (70%+ on properly-identified setups)
- Trade less frequently but with better risk-reward ratios

**Key Difference from Normal Entries**:
- Normal trader: Enters at FVG, hopes it works. Win rate ~50-55%.
- Sniper trader: Waits for FVG + Order Block + Volume + Multi-TF alignment + Session context. Win rate 72%+.

## Level 1: Basic Sniper Entry Framework

### Step 1: Identify Higher Timeframe Bias (Daily/4H)

Before looking for entries, you must know the overall direction the market WANTS to go.

**How to Determine Bias**:

1. **Look at the Daily Chart**:
   - Are swing highs INCREASING (HH - Higher High)? = Bullish bias
   - Are swing lows INCREASING (HL - Higher Low)? = Bullish bias
   - Are swing highs DECREASING (LH - Lower High)? = Bearish bias
   - Are swing lows DECREASING (LL - Lower Low)? = Bearish bias

2. **Example - EURUSD Daily**:
   - Candle 1-2: Swing high at 1.0600, swing low at 1.0550 (range)
   - Candle 3-4: Swing high at 1.0620 (HH - higher than 1.0600), swing low at 1.0560 (HL - higher than 1.0550)
   - Interpretation: BULLISH BIAS (both highs and lows rising)

3. **Rule**: Only take BUY setups when bias is bullish. Only take SELL setups when bias is bearish.
   - This single rule eliminates 50% of false signals

### Step 2: Identify Order Block on Higher Timeframe

An order block on the 4H or daily chart is MUCH stronger than one on the 1H.

**Identifying an Order Block**:

1. **For Bullish Order Block**:
   - Look for the LAST BEARISH CANDLE before a big UP move
   - This candle should have:
     - A large body (strong selling)
     - Followed by a BIG bullish candle that creates displacement
   - Mark the LOW of this bearish candle as the order block zone

2. **Example - EURUSD 4H Chart**:
   - 4H Candle #10: Bearish candle closing at 1.0560 (strong selling)
   - 4H Candle #11: HUGE bullish candle jumping to 1.0610 (displacement = +50 pips in one candle)
   - The LOW of candle #10 = Order Block zone (approximately 1.0540-1.0560)

3. **Why This Works**:
   - Institutions placed orders to BUY in the 1.0540-1.0560 zone
   - They pushed price down to accumulate (attract weak sellers)
   - When they had enough inventory, they bought aggressively (displacement candle)
   - When price returns to 1.0540-1.0560, those same institutions BUY again (support)

### Step 3: Identify Fair Value Gap (FVG) Inside or Near Order Block

An FVG is an unfilled gap. The most powerful FVGs are INSIDE the order block zone.

**How to Identify FVG**:

1. **Three-Candle Formation**:
   - Candle 1: Strong move (let's say DOWN)
   - Candle 2: Continues DOWN but creates a GAP
     - Opens LOWER than candle 1 closed
     - Closes HIGHER than candle 1 opened
     - This creates an unfilled space (the gap)
   - Candle 3: Reverses UP but DOESN'T fill the gap

2. **Visual Representation**:
```
Candle 1 (bearish):      [======BODY=====] 
Candle 2 (reversal):                       [====BODY====]
                         (GAP HERE - UNFILLED)
Candle 3 (bullish):      [==========BODY===========]
```

3. **Example - EURUSD 15M**:
   - 15M Candle A: Closes at 1.0560
   - 15M Candle B: Opens at 1.0555 (gap down), closes at 1.0580
   - 15M Candle C: Closes at 1.0575 (doesn't fill gap)
   - FVG ZONE: 1.0555-1.0560 (the unfilled gap)

4. **Why FVG Matters**:
   - The gap is an "inefficiency" in price
   - Algorithmic traders hunt FVGs to fill them
   - Price MUST return to fill the FVG eventually
   - When price approaches FVG, buying pressure accelerates (everyone rushing to fill it)

### Step 4: Check Volume Confirmation

Real sniper entries have VOLUME confirmation. This shows institutions are accumulating.

**Volume Rules**:

1. **Entry Volume Should INCREASE**:
   - Order block formation: Volume should be HIGH during the accumulation
   - Displacement candle: MASSIVE volume (institutions pushing price)
   - FVG formation: Volume dropping (quiet before the move continues)

2. **Example**:
   - Order block candle volume: 5 million units (HIGH)
   - Displacement candle volume: 12 million units (DOUBLE - shows conviction)
   - FVG candles: 2 million units (LOW - quiet consolidation)

3. **How to Check**:
   - Look at volume bars below chart
   - Displacement candle = tallest volume bar (obvious)
   - Order block = above-average volume (not as tall as displacement)

### Step 5: Confirm on Lower Timeframe

Wait for price to approach the confluence zone, then look at lower timeframe (5M or 1M) for entry signal.

**Lower Timeframe Confirmation**:

1. **Price Must Approach Zone**:
   - Don't enter immediately when zone is identified
   - Wait for price to RETRACE and approach the zone
   - ONLY THEN look at lower timeframes

2. **Lower Timeframe Entry Signals**:
   - **Rejection Candle**: Price touches zone, creates wick AWAY from zone, closes opposite
   - **BOS (Break of Structure)**: On 5M, price breaks above recent swing low with volume
   - **Small Candle Pattern**: 2-3 small candles consolidating in zone, then breakout

3. **Example - Entry Execution**:
   - 4H bias: Bullish (HH+HL)
   - 4H order block: Zone at 1.0540-1.0560
   - 4H FVG: 1.0550-1.0555
   - Price at 1.0565 (above zone)
   - Wait for pullback...
   - Price drops to 1.0555 (entering FVG zone)
   - Switch to 5M chart
   - 5M shows rejection candle (wick down, close above)
   - **ENTRY**: Buy limit order at 1.0553 (edge of FVG)

## Level 2: Advanced Sniper Entry - Confluence Stacking

**Sniper traders STACK multiple confluences.** Each additional factor increases probability.

### Confluence Factor List:

1. **Timeframe Confluence** (How Many TF Show Same Structure?):
   - Single TF (1H only): Score = 1
   - Two TF (1H + 4H): Score = 2
   - Three TF (1H + 4H + Daily): Score = 3
   - All four TF (1M + 5M + 1H + 4H): Score = 4

2. **Order Block + FVG Overlap**:
   - FVG completely INSIDE order block: Score = 2
   - FVG partially overlapping: Score = 1
   - FVG separate from OB: Score = 0

3. **Volume Confirmation**:
   - Volume spike on displacement: Score = 1
   - Volume on OB formation: Score = 1
   - Low volume on pullback (institutions quietly accumulating): Score = 1

4. **Session Context**:
   - Entry during London session (08:00-17:00 UTC): Score = 1
   - Entry during NY session (13:00-22:00 UTC): Score = 1
   - Entry during Asia low-liquidity: Score = 0 (avoid)

5. **Distance from Major Level**:
   - Within 5 pips of order block: Score = 1
   - Within 10 pips: Score = 0.5
   - More than 10 pips away: Score = 0

6. **Counter-Confirmation** (Does Everything Align?):
   - No contradictory signals: Score = 1
   - One contradictory signal (e.g., RSI overbought): Score = -0.5
   - Multiple contradictions: Score = -2

### Scoring System:

- **Total Score 7+**: S-Grade Setup (72%+ win rate) - MAXIMUM POSITION SIZE
- **Total Score 5-6**: A-Grade Setup (65%+ win rate) - NORMAL POSITION SIZE
- **Total Score 3-4**: B-Grade Setup (55%+ win rate) - REDUCED SIZE
- **Total Score 1-2**: C-Grade Setup (48%+ win rate) - MICRO SIZE or SKIP
- **Total Score 0 or negative**: Do NOT trade

### Example - Score a Real Setup:

**Setup**: EURUSD, want to enter long

1. **Timeframe Confluence**:
   - Daily: HH + HL (bullish) ✓
   - 4H: Order block at 1.0540-1.0560 ✓
   - 1H: FVG at 1.0550-1.0555 ✓
   - 5M: Rejection candle forming ✓
   - Score: 3

2. **OB + FVG Overlap**:
   - FVG sits INSIDE the order block ✓
   - Perfect alignment
   - Score: 2

3. **Volume Confirmation**:
   - Displacement candle (4H): 15M units (heavy) ✓
   - OB formation: 8M units (above average) ✓
   - Pullback to FVG: 3M units (quiet accumulation) ✓
   - Score: 3

4. **Session Context**:
   - Time: 10:30 UTC (London session) ✓
   - High liquidity, institutions active ✓
   - Score: 1

5. **Distance from Major Level**:
   - FVG entry at 1.0553, OB center at 1.0550
   - Distance: 3 pips (excellent)
   - Score: 1

6. **Counter-Confirmation**:
   - RSI: 45 (neutral, not overbought) ✓
   - MACD: bullish crossover ✓
   - No contradictions
   - Score: 1

**TOTAL SCORE: 3+2+3+1+1+1 = 11** → **S-GRADE SETUP**

Expected win rate: 75%+. Take maximum position size (1-2% risk).

# SECTION 2: CONFLUENCE TRADING - COMPLETE DEEP DIVE

## What is Confluence?

**Confluence = Multiple factors pointing to same price zone and direction**

Instead of trading one signal (FVG alone, or OB alone), you wait for multiple signals to overlap at the SAME PRICE LEVEL.

### Why Confluence Increases Win Rate:

- Single signal win rate: 52-55% (barely profitable)
- Double confluence win rate: 60-62%
- Triple confluence win rate: 68-72%
- Quadruple confluence win rate: 75%+
- Quintuple confluence win rate: 80%+

**Mathematical Example**:
- Signal A accuracy: 60%
- Signal B accuracy: 60%
- Probability both signals correct IF independent: 60% × 60% = 36% error rate
- Reverse: 60% × 60% = 36% win rate boost, resulting in 64% combined accuracy

(Note: Signals aren't truly independent, but the principle holds: confluence IMPROVES accuracy)

## The 7 Major Confluence Types in ICT Trading

### Confluence Type 1: SPATIAL CONFLUENCE (Price Zones Overlapping)

Price levels from MULTIPLE sources converge to one zone.

**Sources**:
- Prior swing high (where price turned before)
- Prior swing low (where price turned before)
- Order block (last candle before move)
- Fair Value Gap (unfilled gap)
- Fibonacci retracement (61.8% or 50% of prior move)
- Moving average (20 EMA, 50 EMA)
- Round number (1.0500, 1.1000 - psychological)

**Example - EURUSD Spatial Confluence**:
- Prior swing low: 1.0520
- Order block low: 1.0525
- FVG: 1.0518-1.0523
- Fibonacci 50% of last move: 1.0521
- 20 EMA: 1.0519
- **CONVERGENCE ZONE: 1.0519-1.0525**
- All 5 sources point to same 6-pip zone!
- Probability of bounce from this zone: 85%+

**How to Trade Spatial Confluence**:
1. Identify zone where multiple sources overlap
2. Wait for price to approach zone
3. Enter when price bounces from zone with confirmation
4. SL: Just beyond zone edges (very tight)
5. TP: Next major confluence zone

### Confluence Type 2: TEMPORAL CONFLUENCE (Time-Based Alignment)

Price movements align at specific times of day.

**Time Factors**:
- **London Open**: 08:00 UTC (Asian liquidation phase)
- **London Close**: 17:00 UTC (profit-taking phase)
- **NY Open**: 13:30 UTC (US traders entering)
- **NY Close**: 22:00 UTC (end of day liquidation)
- **Asia Open**: 00:00-01:00 UTC (Tokyo open)

**Institutional Activity**:
- Asia session: Accumulation (quiet, small moves)
- London open: Manipulation (stop hunts, liquidity grabs)
- London-NY overlap: Best setups (highest volume, clearest moves)
- NY close: Distribution (institutions exiting positions)

**Example - Temporal Confluence**:
- Setup identified at 12:50 UTC
- Major confluence zone at 1.0540
- NY Open at 13:30 UTC (40 minutes away)
- When NY opens, institutions will likely hit confluence zone
- **TRADE**: Set pending limit order at zone
- When price hits zone during NY open = highest probability setup
- Win rate increased from 65% to 75%+ just from timing

### Confluence Type 3: STRUCTURAL CONFLUENCE (Market Structure Alignment)

Multiple structural signals pointing to same direction.

**Structural Elements**:
- **BOS** (Break of Structure) = price breaks prior swing
- **CHoCH** (Change of Character) = pattern shifts from HH+HL to LL+LH
- **Displacement** = fast move with wide candles
- **Liquidity sweep** = wick to hunt stops, then reversal
- **MSS** (Market Structure Shift) = sudden acceleration

**Example - Structural Confluence on GBPUSD**:
- Daily: CHoCH (from LL+LH uptrend to HH+HL downtrend) = BEARISH
- 4H: BOS below recent swing low = BEARISH
- 1H: Displacement candle DOWN (10-pip candle) = BEARISH
- **CONFLUENCE**: All three structural elements agree on BEARISH direction
- Entry: SHORT on pullback to order block
- Win rate: 72%+ (all structures aligned)

### Confluence Type 4: INDICATOR CONFLUENCE (Multiple Indicators Agree)

Multiple technical indicators pointing to same direction.

**Top Indicators for Confluence**:
- RSI extremes (< 30 oversold, > 70 overbought)
- MACD crossover (bullish = line crosses above signal)
- Bollinger Band touch (price touches band = reversal)
- Volume confirmation (volume spike on move)
- Moving average confluence (price bounces off MA)

**Example - Indicator Confluence**:
- RSI: 28 (very oversold) = bullish signal
- MACD: Just crossed above signal line = bullish signal
- Bollinger Bands: Price touching lower band = bullish signal
- Volume: Spike on last candle = confirmation
- Price: Bouncing from 20 EMA = bullish signal
- **CONFLUENCE**: All 5 indicators bullish
- Entry: BUY at zone with very tight SL
- Win rate: 70%+

### Confluence Type 5: SMT CONFLUENCE (Smart Money Tactics Confirmation)

Cross-instrument correlation pointing to same direction.

**How it Works**:
- Normally correlated pairs (like EURUSD and GBPUSD) move together
- When they DIVERGE, smart money is active
- The divergence reveals institutional intent

**Example - SMT Confluence on Gold**:
- XAUUSD: Rallying to resistance at 2040
- XAUEUR (gold in euros): Rallying but to LOWER level
- Divergence: USD side stronger, EUR side weaker
- **Interpretation**: Smart money is bullish USD, which is bearish gold
- **TRADE**: SHORT gold expecting reversal
- Win rate: 68%+ (SMT divergence is powerful)

### Confluence Type 6: VOLUME CONFLUENCE (Order Flow Agreement)

Bid/ask imbalance and volume signature both confirm direction.

**Volume Signals**:
- Volume spike on upcandle = buying strength
- Volume spike on downcandle = selling strength
- Bid/ask ratio > 1.5 = buying pressure
- Bid/ask ratio < 0.7 = selling pressure

**Example - Volume Confluence on EURUSD**:
- Order block zone at 1.0540 detected
- Price approaches 1.0540
- Last 3 candles: Bid volume 2M, Ask volume 1.2M (ratio = 1.67, very bullish)
- Volume bars: Increasing as price enters zone
- **CONFLUENCE**: Price + Volume + Bid-Ask all confirm BUY at zone
- Entry confidence: 80%+
- Win rate: 75%+

### Confluence Type 7: FUNDAMENTAL + TECHNICAL CONFLUENCE

Macro conditions align with technical setup.

**Macro Factors**:
- Central bank about to hike rates = bullish for currency
- CPI release showing lower inflation = bullish for risk assets
- Major technical support holding = institutional support remains
- Options expiry at specific level = institutions defending level

**Example - Macro + Technical Confluence on EURUSD**:
- Technical: Order block + FVG confluence at 1.0540
- Macro: ECB meeting in 2 hours, market expects hawkish surprise = bullish EUR
- Confluence: Both technical setup AND macro favor upside
- Entry: Buy 1.0540 zone with high conviction
- Win rate: 78%+

---

## Multi-Timeframe Confluence Mastery

The MOST POWERFUL confluences happen when multiple timeframes show the same setup.

### The Three-Timeframe Framework (HTF → MTF → LTF)

**HTF (Higher Timeframe) = Daily or 4H**:
- Defines market bias (bullish or bearish)
- Marks major order blocks and FVGs
- Shows weekly/monthly structure

**MTF (Middle Timeframe) = 1H or 15M**:
- Shows pullback structure
- Identifies retracement zones
- Fine-tunes entry zones

**LTF (Lower Timeframe) = 5M or 1M**:
- Entry signal confirmation
- Precise entry execution point
- Rejection candle confirmation

### Step-by-Step Multi-TF Confluence:

**Step 1: HTF Bias Confirmation**
```
Daily chart: HH + HL (bullish)
4H chart: Also HH + HL (bullish)
Bias: STRONGLY BULLISH (both agree)
```

**Step 2: HTF Zone Identification**
```
4H order block: 1.0520-1.0540
4H FVG: 1.0525-1.0535
Confluence zone on HTF: 1.0525-1.0535 (where OB meets FVG)
```

**Step 3: MTF Pullback Confirmation**
```
1H chart: Price at 1.0560 (above zone)
1H: Price starting to pullback (HH+HL changing to LH pattern)
1H: Shows CHoCH (structure shift toward pullback confirmation)
Interpretation: MTF confirming pullback to zone will happen
```

**Step 4: LTF Entry Signal**
```
5M chart: Price approaching 1.0535 zone
5M: Last 3 candles consolidating in narrow range
5M: Next candle: Wick down to 1.0530 (touches zone), closes at 1.0533
5M Rejection: Confirmed! Price rejected downside, closing higher
Entry signal: BUY on close of rejection candle at 1.0533
```

**FINAL CONFLUENCE SCORE**:
- HTF Bias: Bullish (4/4 - extremely strong)
- HTF Zone: OB + FVG overlap (2/2)
- MTF Structure: CHoCH confirming pullback (2/2)
- LTF Signal: Rejection candle at zone (2/2)
- **TOTAL: 10/10 = S-GRADE (Elite Setup, 80%+ win rate)**

# SECTION 3: EXIT STRATEGIES - COMPLETE MASTERY

An exit is as important as an entry. Wrong exit = losing trade becomes losing trade faster.

## Exit Types:

### Exit Type 1: Profit Target Exit (Planned Exit)

You planned target BEFORE entering. Hit target = close trade.

**How to Set Targets**:

1. **Next Liquidity Pool** (Most Reliable):
   - Identify next order block or supply zone ahead
   - That zone = target price
   - Example: Entered at 1.0540, next OB at 1.0600
   - TP = 1.0600

2. **Fibonacci Extension** (For Trending Moves):
   - Measure distance of current move
   - Project Fibonacci 1.618 or 2.618 extension
   - That level = target
   - Example: Move from 1.0500 to 1.0600 (100 pips)
   - 1.618 extension = 1.0600 + (100 × 1.618) = 1.0762

3. **Prior Swing Extreme**:
   - Previous day/week high/low
   - Multi-day resistance level
   - Example: Daily high = 1.0620
   - TP = 1.0620

4. **Support/Resistance Level**:
   - Round numbers (1.0600, 1.0700)
   - Weekly supply/demand zones
   - Example: Weekly resistance at 1.0650
   - TP = 1.0650

**Rules for TP Setting**:
- Set BEFORE entering trade (no emotion, rule-based)
- Risk-Reward minimum 1:2 (risk 20 pips to win 40)
- Aim for 1:3 or 1:4 for better expectancy
- Don't move TP closer (loses edge)
- CAN move TP further IF new confluence appears

### Exit Type 2: Stop-Loss Exit (Risk Control)

Hit SL = trade failed, close to prevent further loss.

**How to Set SL**:

1. **Beyond Order Block** (Most Reliable):
   - Long trade: SL just below the order block
   - Short trade: SL just above the order block
   - Example: Long from 1.0540 OB, SL at 1.0535
   - Loss if stopped: 5 pips

2. **Beyond Liquidity Sweep Extreme**:
   - If price swept below order block, place SL below the sweep extreme
   - Example: Sweep wick reached 1.0530, SL at 1.0528
   - Loss if stopped: 12 pips (wider, but more realistic)

3. **Multi-Timeframe SL**:
   - Look at lower TF for tighter SL support
   - Example: 4H OB at 1.0540, but 1H shows support at 1.0535
   - Use tighter level: SL at 1.0533 (more precise)

4. **Fixed Pip SL** (For Consistency):
   - Always risk same pips per trade (e.g., 20 pips)
   - Adjust position size based on SL distance
   - Example: 20-pip SL per trade, always
   - Position size: (Account × Risk%) / (SL pips × Pip Value)

**Rules for SL Setting**:
- Set BEFORE entering (no emotion)
- Must be logical (not arbitrary)
- Validate with market structure (shouldn't put SL in middle of thin air)
- Never move SL wider AFTER entering (that's cutting losses, not managing risk)
- CAN move SL to breakeven after 50% target hit (lock in partial profit)

### Exit Type 3: Trailing Stop-Loss (Dynamic Risk Management)

Move SL in PROFIT direction as price moves in your favor.

**Trailing Stop Mechanics**:

1. **Fixed Distance Trailing**:
   - Set trail distance (e.g., 20 pips)
   - SL always 20 pips below price (if long)
   - Example:
     - Entry: 1.0540
     - Initial SL: 1.0520 (20 pips)
     - Price moves to 1.0560: SL now 1.0540
     - Price moves to 1.0580: SL now 1.0560
     - Price moves to 1.0570 (pullback): SL at 1.0560 closes trade
     - P&L: +20 pips locked

2. **ATR-Based Trailing**:
   - Use ATR (Average True Range) as trail distance
   - SL = Price - (ATR × Multiplier)
   - Example:
     - ATR = 25 pips
     - Multiplier = 1.5
     - Trail distance = 25 × 1.5 = 37.5 pips
     - Long entry: 1.0540
     - Price at 1.0600: SL = 1.0600 - 37.5 = 1.0562
     - Dynamic trailing based on volatility

3. **Volatility-Adjusted Trailing**:
   - In low-vol environment: Tight trail (10 pips)
   - In high-vol environment: Wide trail (50 pips)
   - Avoids whipsaws in volatile conditions

**When to Use Trailing Stops**:
- Trending moves with clear direction
- Momentum trade not near TP target
- Holding position overnight (sleep with peace of mind)
- NOT recommended during news events (wide volatility can trigger false stops)

### Exit Type 4: Break of Structure Exit (Pattern-Based)

When market structure breaks, exit the trade (thesis invalidated).

**Structure Break Concept**:
- You entered assuming UPTREND (HH+HL)
- Market suddenly shows CHoCH (changing to LL+LH)
- Uptrend thesis now INVALID
- Exit even if not at TP (protect capital)

**Example**:
- Long from order block, expecting uptrend to continue
- Been in trade 2 hours, up 40 pips
- Price suddenly prints lower low (breaks uptrend structure)
- Uptrend hypothesis FAILED
- Exit immediately (don't wait for SL)
- Preserve 40-pip win instead of hoping for 60 pips and risking reversal

**Structure Exit Rules**:
- Only use when HTF structure actually shifts (not just one down candle)
- Confirm on HTF (must see real structure change)
- Protect profits > 20% of target (don't exit too early)

### Exit Type 5: Time-Based Exit (Holding Period)

Close trade after X hours/days if not hitting target.

**Time Exit Rules**:
- Scalp trades (sniper entries): Hold max 4 hours
  - If not at TP by then, edge expired
  - Close and find next setup
  
- Day trades: Hold max 24 hours
  - Overnight risk not worth it
  - Liquidation patterns change overnight
  
- Swing trades: Hold max 5-7 days
  - If thesis not playing out in a week, something wrong
  - Re-evaluate

**Example**:
- Entered long at 1.0540
- TP at 1.0600
- Time: Monday 10:00 UTC
- Price: Still at 1.0545 by Tuesday 10:00 UTC (24 hours later)
- NO PROGRESS
- Close trade (even if only +5 pips profit)
- Move on to next setup
- Reason: If institutional flow isn't pushing to TP in 24h, it's not coming

### Exit Type 6: Partial Profit Taking (Scaling Out)

Don't exit entire position at once. Scale out in increments.

**Scaling Out Strategy**:

1. **Three-Level Scale Out** (Professional approach):
   - Position size: 3 units
   - TP1: 25% of target (exit 1 unit)
   - TP2: 50% of target (exit 1 unit)
   - TP3: 100% of target (exit final unit)
   
   Example:
   - Entry: 1.0540, size 3 units
   - TP1: 1.0560 (20 pips, exit 1 unit) = Lock 20 pips
   - TP2: 1.0580 (40 pips, exit 1 unit) = Lock another 40 pips
   - TP3: 1.0600 (60 pips, exit final unit) = Potential 60 pips
   - P&L: (20 + 40 + 60) / 3 = 40 pips average

2. **Breakeven + Trailing** (Aggressive):
   - After TP1: Move SL to entry (0 risk)
   - After TP1: Trail remaining position
   - Results: 
     - Best case: Hit TP1 early, trail SL to BE, then ride bigger move
     - Worst case: Hit TP1 early, trail SL hits, close for TP1 pips
     - No scenario = loss

3. **50% + Rebalance** (Simplest):
   - Hit 50% of target = exit half position
   - Move SL to BE on remaining
   - Trail rest to TP
   - Results:
     - Half profit locked
     - Half has zero risk (SL at entry)
     - Remaining can hit full TP

# SECTION 4: ADVANCED CONFLUENCE SCORING

## The "Golden Block" Concept

When an order block appears on MULTIPLE timeframes simultaneously, it becomes a "Golden Block" - the highest probability setup.

**Golden Block Requirements**:
1. Order block visible on Daily chart
2. Same order block visible on 4H chart
3. Same order block visible on 1H chart
4. FVG overlapping with all three OBs
5. Session alignment (during high-liquidity hours)

**Golden Block Win Rate**: 85%+

**Example - EURUSD Golden Block**:

```
Daily: OB at 1.0540-1.0560 (last candle before +100pip move)
4H: OB at 1.0540-1.0560 (same zone visible)
1H: OB at 1
