## SECTION 1: COMPLETE TECHNICAL INDICATORS MASTER COURSE (100+ Indicators)

### 1.1 Trend Following Indicators

**Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- Calculation: Average of last N closing prices
- SMA 50: Average of last 50 closes; represents short-term trend
- SMA 200: Average of last 200 closes; represents long-term trend
- Interpretation: Price above SMA = uptrend; price below SMA = downtrend
- Golden Cross: SMA50 crosses above SMA200 = strong bullish signal
- Death Cross: SMA50 crosses below SMA200 = strong bearish signal
- AI Usage: Entry when price pulls back to SMA50 (short-term support) in uptrend

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- Calculation: Like SMA but weighs recent prices more heavily
- EMA50: More responsive than SMA50 (reacts faster to price changes)
- EMA200: Long-term trend filter
- Advantage over SMA: Reacts faster to trend changes
- AI Usage: EMA50/EMA200 crossover as entry trigger; price > EMA50 = bullish

**Hull Moving Average (HMA)**
- Calculation: Weighted MA using 2x weight on middle section
- Advantage: Even more responsive than EMA; less lag
- Use: Entry/exit triggers in faster markets (crypto, forex)
- AI Usage: HMA crossover for shorter timeframes (1m-5m)

**KAMA (Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average)**
- Calculation: Adjusts smoothing based on market volatility
- Lower volatility: KAMA smoother (follows trend better)
- Higher volatility: KAMA more responsive (avoids fake-outs)
- Use: Objective moving average that adapts to regime
- AI Usage: KAMA as dynamic support/resistance level

**TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)**
- Calculation: Combination of three EMAs for ultra-smooth, minimal lag
- Use: Very reliable for trend, minimal false signals
- AI Usage: Long-term trend confirmation

---

### 1.2 Momentum Indicators

**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- Calculation: RS = Average Gain / Average Loss; RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
- RSI Range: 0-100
- Overbought: RSI > 70 (price moved up too far, likely pullback)
- Oversold: RSI < 30 (price moved down too far, likely bounce)
- Interpretation: RSI = 50 is neutral midpoint
- Usage: 
  - RSI > 70 at resistance = likely sell setup (mean-reversion)
  - RSI < 30 at support = likely buy setup (mean-reversion)
  - RSI divergence: Price makes higher high but RSI makes lower high = momentum fading, sell signal
- AI Usage: RSI divergence at supply zone = grade boost

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- Calculation: 
  - MACD line = EMA12 - EMA26
  - Signal line = EMA9 of MACD line
  - Histogram = MACD line - Signal line
- Interpretation:
  - MACD crosses above signal = bullish momentum (BUY signal)
  - MACD crosses below signal = bearish momentum (SELL signal)
  - Histogram size = strength of momentum (larger = stronger)
  - Positive histogram = bullish; negative histogram = bearish
- AI Usage:
  - MACD crossover at order block = grade boost to B-A
  - MACD divergence (price HH but MACD LH) = momentum fading, short signal

**Stochastic Oscillator**
- Calculation: %K = 100 * (Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)
- Range: 0-100
- %D = moving average of %K
- Overbought: %K > 80 (sell signal)
- Oversold: %K < 20 (buy signal)
- Crossover: %K crosses above %D = bullish; %K crosses below %D = bearish
- AI Usage: Stochastic oversold at demand zone = strong buy signal

**Williams %R**
- Similar to Stochastic but inverted scale (0 to -100)
- Overbought: < -20
- Oversold: < -80
- Usage: Similar to Stochastic; alternative perspective

**Momentum Oscillator**
- Calculation: Current Close - Close N periods ago
- Positive = uptrend; negative = downtrend
- Size of value = strength of momentum
- Usage: Trending strength measurement

**Rate of Change (ROC)**
- Calculation: ((Close - Close N periods ago) / Close N periods ago) * 100
- Percentage change; shows velocity of price movement
- Usage: Identify acceleration/deceleration

---

### 1.3 Mean Reversion Indicators

**Bollinger Bands**
- Calculation: 
  - Middle Band = 20-period SMA
  - Upper Band = Middle + (2 × 20-period std dev)
  - Lower Band = Middle - (2 × 20-period std dev)
- Interpretation:
  - Price > upper band = overbought (reversion to middle likely)
  - Price < lower band = oversold (reversion to middle likely)
  - Squeeze: Bands tight together = low volatility, breakout coming
  - Expansion: Bands wide = high volatility, consolidation coming
- Entry Rule: Price 2 std dev above = short toward middle; 2 std dev below = long toward middle
- AI Usage: Bollinger band squeeze + order block = preparation for big move

**Keltner Channel**
- Similar to Bollinger but uses ATR instead of std dev
- Bands: Middle Band ± (ATR × 2)
- Advantage: More responsive to current volatility
- Usage: Same as Bollinger (overbought/oversold)

**Moving Average Envelopes**
- Upper envelope = EMA + X% above
- Lower envelope = EMA - X% below
- Usage: Price reaching envelope = extreme, pullback likely

**VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**
- Calculation: Sum(Price × Volume) / Sum(Volume)
- Represents price where largest volume traded
- Usage: Support/resistance level; price extremes pull back to VWAP
- AI Usage: Price spike above/below VWAP = mean-reversion entry near VWAP

---

### 1.4 Volatility Indicators

**Average True Range (ATR)**
- Calculation: Average of "true range" (highest high to lowest low, accounting for gaps)
- Interpretation: Size of ATR = volatility level
- High ATR = high volatility (large candles, big moves)
- Low ATR = low volatility (small candles, tight range)
- Usage:
  - Set SL width based on ATR (SL = ATR × 2, for example)
  - Set target based on ATR (TP = ATR × 3)
  - Breakout detection: Move > ATR × 2 in 1 candle = strong breakout
- AI Usage: ATR multiplier for dynamic SL/TP sizing

**Historical Volatility**
- Calculation: Standard deviation of log returns over N periods
- High HV = high variance in returns = high risk
- Low HV = prices stable = low risk
- Usage: Regime detection (high-vol regime vs low-vol regime)

**Bollinger Band Width**
- Calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band
- Width expanding = volatility expanding
- Width contracting = volatility contracting (squeeze coming)
- Usage: Volatility regime indicator

**Donchian Channel**
- Calculation: Highest high and lowest low of last N periods
- Upper band = highest high in N periods
- Lower band = lowest low in N periods
- Usage:
  - Breakout strategy: Buy break above upper band, SL below lower band
  - Volatility measure: Channel width shows volatility
- AI Usage: Donchian breakout + order block = strong breakout setup

---

### 1.5 Volume & Order Flow Indicators

**On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- Calculation: If close > prior close, OBV = prior OBV + volume; if close < prior close, OBV = prior OBV - volume
- Interpretation: OBV rising = accumulation (buyers in control); OBV falling = distribution (sellers in control)
- Divergence: Price makes new high but OBV lower = bearish divergence (sell signal)
- Usage: Confirm breakout with volume

**Accumulation/Distribution (A/D)**
- Similar to OBV but weights volume by where close is within candle range
- Close near high = more accumulation; close near low = more distribution
- Usage: Volume-weighted signal; more nuanced than OBV

**Money Flow Index (MFI)**
- Calculation: Combines price and volume; RSI but with volume weighting
- Range: 0-100
- Overbought: > 80; Oversold: < 20
- Divergence: Price high but MFI low = selling pressure, bearish

**Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**
- Calculation: Volume-weighted money flow over N periods
- Positive = accumulation; negative = distribution
- Usage: Identify periods of net buying vs selling

**Volume Profile**
- Visualization: Histogram showing volume traded at each price level
- High volume node = price level with most trading activity
- Usage: Support/resistance (price levels with high volume are sticky)
- Point of Control (POC) = highest volume level
- Value Area = 70% of trading volume concentration

**VPIN (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading)**
- Advanced measure of order-flow toxicity
- High VPIN = informed traders active (likely big move coming)
- Low VPIN = retail traders, less predictive
- Usage: Advance warning of volatility spike

---

### 1.6 Breadth & Strength Indicators

**Average Directional Index (ADX)**
- Calculation: Measures trend strength (not direction)
- ADX > 25 = strong trend (use trend-following strategies)
- ADX < 20 = weak trend, ranging (use mean-reversion strategies)
- ADX 20-25 = transition zone
- +DI and -DI = directional indicators (which direction is strong)
- Usage: Regime selector (trending vs ranging)
- AI Usage: ADX > 25 = activate momentum strategies; ADX < 20 = activate mean-reversion

**Aroon Indicator**
- Aroon Up = periods since highest high; Aroon Down = periods since lowest low
- Range: 0-100
- Aroon Up > 70 & Aroon Down < 30 = strong uptrend
- Aroon Down > 70 & Aroon Up < 30 = strong downtrend
- Crossover = trend change
- Usage: Trend direction and strength

**Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**
- Calculation: (Typical Price - SMA) / (0.015 × Mean Deviation)
- Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Range: -100 to +100
- > +100 = overbought; < -100 = oversold
- Usage: Mean-reversion (extreme CCI = reversal likely)

**Directional Movement (DM / DMI)**
- +DM = uptrend strength (how high the high)
- -DM = downtrend strength (how low the low)
- +DI = +DM / ATR (normalized uptrend)
- -DI = -DM / ATR (normalized downtrend)
- Crossover: +DI crosses +DI = trend change
- Usage: Trend direction confirmation

---

### 1.7 Advanced Microstructure Indicators

**Order Book Imbalance Ratio**
- Calculation: Bid volume / Ask volume
- > 1.0 = more buyers than sellers (bullish)
- < 1.0 = more sellers than buyers (bearish)
- Extreme ratio (> 2.0 or < 0.5) = potential reversal after absorption
- Usage: Real-time momentum indicator (updates every second)

**Trade Flow Delta**
- Calculation: Buy volume - Sell volume over a period
- Positive delta = net buying pressure
- Negative delta = net selling pressure
- Large spike = smart money accumulation/distribution
- Usage: Detect institutional order flow

**VWAP - Microstructure Signal**
- When price spikes above VWAP, it's overextended; pullback likely
- When price spikes below VWAP, it's oversold; bounce likely
- Usage: Mean-reversion within-day strategy

**Bid-Ask Spread**
- Tight spread = high liquidity, easy entry/exit
- Wide spread = low liquidity, slippage risk, avoid entry
- Spread widening = volatility spike warning
- Usage: Position sizing (wider spread = smaller position)

## SECTION 2: QUANTITATIVE TRADING STRATEGIES COMPLETE COURSE

### 2.1 Momentum Strategies (Time-Series)

**Trend Following with Volatility Targeting**
- Concept: Buy uptrend, sell downtrend; adjust position size by volatility
- Signal: Price > 50-EMA (uptrend); buy on close above recent swing high
- Volatility target: If realized vol = 10%, target position size = 100 / 10 = 10x leverage (or as % of account)
- SL: Trail with 30-pip stop (or 2×ATR)
- TP: Scale out at 100 pips, 200 pips, trail rest
- Win rate: ~48% (wins > losses on average even with <50% win rate due to trailing)
- Holding time: Hours to days
- Best in: Trending markets (ADX > 25)

**Breakout with Retest**
- Signal: Price breaks above resistance on volume
- Confirmation: Price pulls back to broken level, respects it (bounce)
- Entry: On retest bounce (buy when bounces off previously-broken level)
- SL: Below the retest support (just under pullback low)
- TP: Next major resistance or swing high
- Win rate: ~58% (very reliable pattern)
- Best in: Breakout-heavy markets (after periods of consolidation)

**Carry Strategy (FX/Futures)**
- Concept: Earn interest rate differential while trading
- Example: USDJPY carry trade: borrow JPY at near-0%, lend USD at 5.5% = 5.5% carry
- Position: Long USDJPY in carry (earn +0.55% per annum on position)
- Entry: On structural support (buy low in carry pairs)
- Exit: When trend reverses or macro changes
- Risk: Carry trades reverse sharply in risk-off (VIX spike)
- AI Usage: Carry weighting in allocation; reduce size when VIX > 20

**Seasonality**
- Concept: Some months/weeks historically outperform
- Example: Gold historically rallies Sept-Nov (hedging season); gold weakens Jan-Feb
- Entry: One month before seasonal strength; exit when season ends
- Win rate: 55-65% depending on how strong seasonal effect
- Risk: Seasonal patterns can break
- AI Usage: Tag seasonal months and bias trades accordingly

---

### 2.2 Mean Reversion Strategies

**Bollinger Band Reversion**
- Signal: Price > +2std dev from SMA20
- Entry: Sell at band extreme (or SMA if risk-averse)
- SL: Above upper band
- TP: SMA20 or lower band
- Holding time: Hours to 1 day
- Win rate: 62-65% (very reliable)
- Best in: Low-vol ranging markets
- Caution: In strong trends, mean reversion gets stopped out; must have trend filter

**RSI Extremes**
- Signal: RSI > 70 (overbought) at resistance zone
- Entry: Short limit order at resistance
- SL: Above resistance
- TP: Moving average or swing low
- Win rate: 58-62%
- Holding time: Hours
- Caution: Can fail in strong uptrends

**VWAP Reversion**
- Signal: Price spikes >1std dev above VWAP during day
- Entry: Sell when above VWAP extreme
- SL: Above spike high
- TP: VWAP or below
- Holding time: Minutes to hours
- Win rate: 60-65% (very reliable intraday)

**Z-Score Mean Reversion (Quant)**
- Calculation: Z = (price - MA) / std dev
- Signal: Z > 2.0 (very overbought) or Z < -2.0 (very oversold)
- Entry: When Z extreme, trade toward mean (short if Z>2, long if Z<-2)
- TP: Z = 0 (back to mean)
- SL: Z = 2.5 (extreme beyond target)
- Win rate: 65-70%
- Statistical foundation: Regression to mean is powerful
- Caution: Doesn't work in trending markets; must have trend filter

---

### 2.3 Statistical Arbitrage (Pairs Trading)

**Cointegrated Pairs Strategy**
- Identification: Find two correlated instruments that have statistical relationship (cointegration)
- Example: EURUSD + GBPUSD (correlation 0.85)
- Spread Definition: EURUSD - (beta × GBPUSD)
- Entry: When spread is 2 std devs from mean (extreme divergence)
- Example Trade:
  - Normal spread = 0.0000
  - Current spread = +0.0050 (EURUSD too strong vs GBPUSD)
  - Entry: SHORT EURUSD, LONG GBPUSD (betting they converge)
  - TP: Spread = 0 (converged)
- SL: Spread = 2.5 std devs (trade thesis broken)
- Win rate: 65-70%
- Edge: Mean reversion of spreads is very reliable
- Holding time: Days to weeks

**Kalman Filter Hedge Ratio**
- Concept: Dynamic hedge ratio; not static like regression
- Kalman filter updates the optimal ratio in real-time
- Advantage: Adapts to changing correlations (market regimes)
- Usage: For pairs trading with changing correlation
- Complexity: Requires more advanced implementation

**Market-Neutral Portfolio Construction**
- Concept: Build long and short positions that are equal notional value and low correlation
- Example:
  - Long: EURUSD (1 lot) = $100,000
  - Short: USDJPY (0.8 lots) = $100,000 equivalent
  - Both sized equally; opposite correlation = market-neutral
- Risk: Pair-specific (spread) risk only; market risk hedged
- Win rate: Depends on alpha generated (alpha can be high since market risk removed)

---

### 2.4 Factor Investing (Cross-Sectional Strategies)

**Value Factor**
- Definition: Buy cheap assets (low P/E, low Price-to-Book), sell expensive
- For forex: Low real rates (after inflation adjustment) make currency cheap
- Example: If Japan has negative real rates (0% - 2% inflation), JPY is cheap; expect JPY strength over time
- Holding time: Medium-term (weeks to months)
- Win rate: 52-55% but with larger winners (value can outperform significantly)

**Momentum Factor**
- Definition: Buy assets with strong recent performance, sell weak performers
- For forex: Currency that rallied 10% in last 6 months likely continues (momentum)
- Holding time: Short to medium (days to weeks)
- Win rate: 55-60%
- Caution: Momentum can reverse fast; need trend confirmation

**Quality Factor**
- Definition: Buy high-quality assets (profitable, stable, low debt)
- For forex: Currency with stable central bank, low inflation, strong growth
- Example: CNY (stable political system, strong growth) > emerging market currencies
- Holding time: Long-term
- Win rate: 55-58%

**Low Volatility Factor**
- Definition: Buy assets with lower historical volatility; outperform risk-adjusted
- For forex: Pairs like EURUSD (low vol) vs exotics like USDZAR (high vol)
- Benefit: Lower volatility = lower drawdown = better Sharpe ratio
- Trade-off: Lower potential returns
- Best for: Conservative portfolios

**Size Factor**
- For forex: Currencies of large economies (USD, EUR, JPY) tend to outperform micro-cap emerging
- Not as strong a factor in forex as equities

**Composite Multi-Factor Score**
- Combine multiple factors into single score
- Example: 40% value + 30% momentum + 20% quality + 10% low-vol
- Rank currencies by composite score
- Long top 25%; short bottom 25%
- Rebalance monthly
- Win rate: 55-65% (diversified across factors)

---

### 2.5 Options-Aware Strategies

**Implied Volatility Extremes**
- High IV = option prices expensive = directional moves less likely (mean reversion likely)
- Low IV = option prices cheap = directional moves likely (trend likely)
- Strategy: When IV extreme high, sell options (collect premium) or trade mean reversion. When IV low, buy options (more likely to expand) or trend-follow.

**IV Term Structure**
- IV curve: IV of near-term options vs far-term options
- Normal: Near-term IV < far-term IV (longer duration = more uncertainty)
- Inverted: Near-term IV > far-term IV (event coming, uncertainty high short-term)
- Strategy: When inverted, expect volatility collapse after event; sell near-term vol

**Skew Trading**
- Skew: IV of out-of-money puts higher than calls (tailrisk premium)
- High skew = investors buying downside protection (risk-off)
- Low skew = risk-on environment
- Strategy: When skew high, VIX likely to spike on down move (short bias); when low, upside breakouts likely

---

## SECTION 3: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS MASTER COURSE

### 3.1 Central Bank Mechanics & Rate Cycles

**Federal Reserve Cycle** (US)
- Stage 1: Rates at zero (crisis/recession), QE on
- Stage 2: Recovery; slow rate hikes begin (Fed Funds Rate 0.25% → 0.5% → etc.)
- Stage 3: Hiking phase; multiple consecutive rate hikes (fast increases like 0.5-0.75% per meeting)
- Stage 4: Hold; rates at "terminal" level (Fed says hikes over); market waits for direction
- Stage 5: Cuts begin if recession signals emerge
- USD behavior: Strengthens during hiking (stage 3); peaks at terminal; weakens during cuts (stage 5)
- AI Usage: Track Fed speaker commentary and futures pricing to anticipate stage changes

**ECB Cycle** (Eurozone)
- Similar to Fed but typically lags Fed by 6-12 months
- When Fed hiking but ECB holding, EURUSD weakness
- When both hiking but Fed faster, EURUSD weakness continues
- When Fed cuts but ECB holds, EURUSD strength

**BOE Cycle** (UK)
- Tends to be more reactive and unpredictable than Fed/ECB
- GBP strength tied to BoE hiking cycle
- Post-Brexit, BoE sometimes misses signals (economic data surprises both ways)

**BOJ Cycle** (Japan)
- Unique: BOJ has held rates near-zero for 20+ years
- Recent move (2023): BOJ signals rate hike coming (first in years)
- Impact: USDJPY rally when BOJ tightens (reducing rate differential)
- Carry trade unwind: When BOJ finally hikes significantly, USDJPY could spike lower (unwinding of massive carry trade)

**Rate Path Expectations**:
- Use Fed Funds futures to read market expectations for future rates
- Example: Fed funds futures price 75% chance of 4.75% by Dec 2024
- If Fed signals 5.5%, but market expects 4.75%, surprise hawkish → USD strength

### 3.2 Inflation Dynamics & Trading

**CPI (Consumer Price Index)** - Most Important Inflation Metric
- Released monthly (US: 2nd Wednesday; other countries: specific dates)
- Measures: Change in prices consumers pay for goods/services
- High CPI (>4%) = inflation elevated = central bank likely to hike rates = currency strong
- Low CPI (<2%) = inflation low = central bank may hold/cut = currency weak
- Core CPI: Excludes volatile food/energy; more stable, more watched

**CPI Trading Mechanics**:
- Before release: Consensus estimate published (market priced-in)
- At release: Actual CPI number (beat or miss vs estimate)
- CPI Beat (higher than estimate) = bullish surprise = currency strength (rate hike expectations rise)
- CPI Miss (lower than estimate) = bearish surprise = currency weakness
- Size of surprise matters: 0.1% beat vs 0.5% beat = different market impact

**Example CPI Trade**:
- Estimate: 3.2% YoY inflation
- Prior: 3.5% YoY
- Market expectation: No change expected; expectations balanced
- Actual: 3.0% YoY (Miss, lower than estimate)
- Market reaction: CPI better than expected → inflation cooling → Fed less aggressive → USD weakness
- EURUSD reaction: Strength (opposite of USD strength) = potential 50-100 pip move

**PPI (Producer Price Index)** - Leading Inflation Indicator
- Released before CPI (usually)
- Measures: Prices manufacturers pay for inputs
- High PPI → future CPI likely high (inflation pipeline flowing)
- PPI release impacts CPI expectations for following month

**Core vs Headline Inflation**:
- Headline: All items including volatile food/energy
- Core: Excludes food/energy (more stable, Fed watches closely)
- Example: Headline 4.5%, core 4.0% = food/energy spike but core stable (transitory inflation)
- If both rising = broader inflation (more concerning)

---

### 3.3 Employment Data & Labor Market

**Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)** - Strongest USD Driver
- Released: First Friday of month, 8:30am EST
- Measures: Number of jobs created in economy last month
- High NFP (e.g., +300k jobs) = strong labor market = Fed can stay hawkish = USD strength
- Low NFP (e.g., +50k jobs) = weak labor market = Fed may cut = USD weakness
- Estimate vs actual: Beat estimate → USD bullish; Miss estimate → USD bearish

**Unemployment Rate**:
- Low unemployment (<3.5%) = tight labor market = wage pressure = inflation risk = Fed hawkish
- High unemployment (>4%) = slack = Fed can relax = soft landing likely
- Prime working-age unemployment: More specific than overall rate; better predictor of Fed action

**Jobless Claims (Weekly)**:
- Released: Every Thursday
- High claims → labor market weakening → Fed might cut
- Low claims → labor market strong → Fed stays hawkish
- Trend matters: Is it rising (labor weakening) or falling (labor strengthening)?

**Wage Growth / Average Hourly Earnings**:
- Strong wage growth (>4% YoY) = inflation driver = Fed concern = hiking bias
- Weak wage growth (<2% YoY) = inflation controlled = Fed can pause = cutting bias
- Fed cares more about this than headline jobs number

---

### 3.4 Economic Growth Data

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**:
- Measures: Total economic output
- High GDP growth (>3%) = strong economy = Fed confident to hike = currency strong
- Low GDP growth (<1%) = economy slowing = Fed may cut = currency weak
- Recession = negative GDP growth (contraction) = crisis mode

**PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index)**:
- Released: Around 1st business day of month (services), manufacturing (24th)
- Measures: Sentiment of purchasing managers (leading indicator of future activity)
- PMI > 50 = expansion; PMI < 50 = contraction
- High PMI (>55) = strong growth expected = bullish for currency
- Low PMI (<45) = recession warning = bearish

**ISM Manufacturing & Services**:
- Similar to PMI but for US specifically
- US version of global PMI

**Industrial Production & Capacity Utilization**:
- Measures: Output of factories and capacity being used
- High industrial production = strong manufacturing = economy healthy
- High capacity utilization (>80%) = inflation risk (operating near limits)

---

### 3.5 Macro Scenarios & Currency Implications

**Scenario 1: Soft Landing (Ideal)**
- Inflation cools → Central bank pauses hikes
- Growth remains okay (avoids recession)
- Markets calm; carries trades thrive
- Currency: Stable with slight upside if rates stay high longer
- EURUSD: Neutral to slight strength (both economies stable)
- Commodity currencies (AUD, CAD): Strength (growth supportive)

**Scenario 2: Hard Landing (Recession)**
- Inflation doesn't cool enough → Fed keeps hiking aggressively
- Or rates already too high → growth crashes → recession
- Markets panic; risk assets sell off; safe-havens rally
- Currency: USD strength (safe-haven), JPY strength (carry unwind)
- EURUSD: Weakness (recession risk)
- Commodity currencies: Weakness (recession demand collapse)
- Gold: Strength (safe-haven + lower real rates)

**Scenario 3: Stagflation (Worst)**
- High inflation + economic stagnation simultaneously
- Central bank paralyzed (can't hike without destroying growth, can't cut while inflation high)
- Markets very volatile
- Currency: Volatile; no clear direction
- Gold: Major strength (inflation + economic stress)
- Traditional investments: Pain

**Scenario 4: Disinflationary Boom (Best)**
- Inflation cools due to supply increases or technology
- Growth accelerates due to lower rates + falling cost inputs
- Central bank cuts rates while economy booming
- Markets euphoric
- Currency: Strength (growth + rate cuts = asset revaluation)
- Commodities: Weakness (inflation down)
- Equities: Major strength

---

## SECTION 4: MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS & QUANT CONCEPTS

### 4.1 Core Statistical Concepts

**Probability Distributions**
- Normal Distribution: Bell curve; 68% of outcomes within 1 std dev, 95% within 2 std dev
- Fat Tails: Markets have more extreme outcomes than normal distribution predicts
- Skewness: Asymmetry in distribution; left skew (tail on left) = crash risk
- Kurtosis: How much "peak" vs "flat" in distribution; high kurtosis = tail risk

**Standard Deviation (Volatility)**
- Measures: Spread of outcomes around mean
- High std dev = high volatility = large price swings
- Low std dev = low volatility = tight consolidations
- Calculation: √(sum of squared deviations / N)

**Z-Score**
- Definition: How many standard deviations away from mean
- Z = (value - mean) / std dev
- Z = 0: At mean
- Z = +2: 2 std devs above mean (extreme)
- Z = -2: 2 std devs below mean (extreme)
- Usage: Identify extreme deviations (mean-reversion triggers)

**Correlation & Covariance**
- Correlation: How two variables move together (-1 to +1)
- Correlation = 1: Perfect positive (move together)
- Correlation = -1: Perfect negative (move opposite)
- Correlation = 0: No relationship
- Covariance: Measure of joint variability (similar concept, different scale)

---

### 4.2 Risk Metrics

**Sharpe Ratio**
- Definition: Risk-adjusted return
- Formula: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
- Example: 10% return, 8% volatility, 2% risk-free rate = (10% - 2%) / 8% = 1.0
- Interpretation: 1.0 = decent; 1.5+ = good; 2.0+ = excellent
- Usage: Compare strategies (higher Sharpe = better risk-adjusted)

**Sortino Ratio**
- Similar to Sharpe but only penalizes downside volatility
- Ignores upside volatility (which isn't bad)
