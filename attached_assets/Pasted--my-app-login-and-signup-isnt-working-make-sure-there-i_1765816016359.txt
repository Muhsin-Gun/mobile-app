 my app login and signup  isnt working make sure there is the login or signup with google which works perfectly we are remodeling reconstructing again this app with depth on what we agreed and analysed before for my crypto app youll check what its missing what doesnt work what needs to be added from top till bottom analyse look at other apps like justmarkets, exness, qumatix , mexc, vantagevetc let it not be only those 3 apps you inspect many more like 20 just analyse and check how they performing and why mine is lacking as i said inspect my codes from top till bottom you should have the idea and the design in your head soo doo deep deep reserach dont tell me what the app is about or language since you will do deep research of the zip file and add ideas that others dont have inside mine and how to improve and boost mine then drop like many many fresh ideas, many ideas on how to booast, many ideas and how to be better etx just implement your whole ideas inside the codes, my app should work on mobile it should have its own charts working charts in my app profile stuff like transaction History notification, dark mode which doesnt work and is very slow when clicked on, help and support isnt working, theres no community chat logout doesnt work, theres no employee dashboard and admin dashboard, for employee dashboard it should be ai enhanced to make its work easier employee section should be able to send notification on mobile phones , complaints customer serviceetc do deeep research and add many more features for that, admin dashboard should be able to track the perfomance of his app, sales many more do research deep deep research next is you should know ict isnt a strategy it teaching how the market moves thats why it will not be effective and will be complete loses ict is knowing how the market moves giving the AI immense knowledge on decision making it should have backtested many strategies and is able to use the most suitable one the AI should be able to use ALL stratgies at once to make its probability higher next is learning i copy pasted what needs to be done for that one only beginner causes should be free and once it goes in depth to intermiadiate, advanced, pro  from there it should be paid not free like ict concept beginner free ict concept intermiade pay and the pay varies depending on the knowledge claude only gave a little bit of information youll do deep research and find full courses for each and every strategy mentioned it should have complete work not notes or shortened i need complete like quant takes 2 years to get a degree and here you finish full course in one topic that doesnt make sense add everything back till finish add everything that takes learners 2 years  next is in the trade section stop hardcoding it the AI should analyse on what it sees on the graph like mine it says buy btc 105990 while btc is at 86 it should learn to follow and analyse what it sees on the chart graph it should use everyt strategy mentioned that i told you and make sure the draw it nicely perfectly inside the chart whatever it analyses like if it finds a deman zone it draws inside the graph and writes deman zone thats just an example make sure you work on improving this ew feature for the graphs check justmarkets, exness where they get there real charts from coz using trading view isnt working on mobiles and the ai should be able to draw on the graph itself make sure you find a suitable option next is the indicators should be adapting to the market chartlike fibonnaci etc and the indicators should be running at the background soo as it doesnt dirtfify the otherndecison makings concepts idk whether you understand me DOM and deep footprints is a must for sniper entries and better decision markings combine it with your strategies and backtest it yourself a good way on how to use it while it runs on the background out of view next is it shouldnt just be crypto and forex include many other stuff make sure its not fake and its following real time data like my app says xauusd is in 2656 that doesnt make sense gold is on 4304 my point is everything should be moving real time data there shouldnt be anything thats simulated there should be NOTHING thats simulated and there should be 2 charts for example the normal xauusd and the xauusd thats well analysed inside the graphs itself which uses and combines every single trading strategy there should be a place where someone can combine 2 or more strategies which isnt free and single strategies which is less the amount  make sure you send me an stk push through my phone number 0793027220 MPESA_ENV=sandbox

Perfect 🔥 — now you’re at the real developer stage.

I’ll explain clearly, step-by-step, no fluff.

🟢 PART 1: APP NAME (what users see)
1️⃣ Change app name (Android)

Open:

android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml


Change:

<string name="app_name">Cryptex Trading</string>


➡ Replace Cryptex Trading with your app name.

2️⃣ Change app name (Web)

Open:

web/index.html


Edit:

<title>Cryptex Trading</title>

3️⃣ Change app name (Flutter label)

Open:

pubspec.yaml


Change:

name: cryptex_trading
description: A crypto analysis and trading app


⚠️ name: must stay lowercase_with_underscores

🟢 PART 2: APP ICON / PROFILE PICTURE (PFP)
✅ BEST WAY (AUTOMATIC ICON GENERATION)
1️⃣ Add dependency
flutter pub add flutter_launcher_icons

2️⃣ Update pubspec.yaml

Add at the bottom:

flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  web:
    generate: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"

3️⃣ Add your icon

Create folder:

assets/icon/


Put:

app_icon.png


✔ Size: 1024×1024
✔ Transparent or solid background

4️⃣ Generate icons
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons


🎉 Your app now has a PFP everywhere (Android + Web)

🟢 PART 3: DOWNLOAD APP (APK / AAB)
🔹 Build APK (share directly)
flutter build apk --release


Output:

build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk


✔ Can be shared
❌ Play Store prefers AAB

🔹 Build AAB (Play Store required)
flutter build appbundle


Output:

build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

🟢 PART 4: PUBLISH TO PLAY STORE (REAL STEPS)
✅ Requirements
Item	Cost
Google Play Developer Account	$25 (one-time)
App Bundle (.aab)	Free
App Icon	Required
Screenshots	Required
📤 Upload Steps

Go to: https://play.google.com/console

Create app

Choose App name

Upload .aab

Add:

App icon

Screenshots

Description

Submit for review

⏳ Review time: 2–7 days

🟢 PART 5: DOWNLOAD FROM WEB (LIKE A PWA)
Build web app:
flutter build web


Upload build/web to:

Netlify

Vercel

Firebase Hosting

Users can:

✔ Open link
✔ Click “Add to Home Screen”
✔ Use like an app

🟢 PART 6: APP ID / PACKAGE NAME (IMPORTANT)
Change Android package name

Default:

com.example.cryptex_trading


Recommended:

com.yourname.cryptex


Use this tool (safe):

flutter pub run change_app_package_name:main com.yourname.cryptex


⚠️ Do this BEFORE Play Store upload

🧠 PRO TIPS (READ THIS)

✔ Don’t use TradingView mobile → policy risk
✔ Add privacy policy URL
✔ Disable fake “financial advice” claims
✔ Add disclaimer:

“This app does not provide financial advice.”
