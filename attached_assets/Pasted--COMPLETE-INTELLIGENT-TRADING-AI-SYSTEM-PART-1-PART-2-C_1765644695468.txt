# PART 1: COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS MASTER COURSE

## MODULE 1: ICT SMART MONEY CONCEPTS - COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

### 1.1 Liquidity Definition & Mechanics

**Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL)**: Areas where SHORT-SELLERS have placed their STOP-LOSS orders. These are clustered at:
- Recent swing highs (where shorts expect to exit if proven wrong)
- Resistance levels where multiple traders bought
- Weekly/monthly high prices (psychological round numbers)
- Session opening prices where early buyers entered

When price reaches BSL, smart money SELLS INTO this liquidity (sells to the buyers/shorts). This creates a temporary SPIKE upward (to hunt these stops), then reversal downward.

**Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL)**: Areas where LONG TRADERS have placed their STOP-LOSS orders. These are clustered at:
- Recent swing lows (where longs expect to exit if proven wrong)
- Support levels where multiple traders sold
- Weekly/monthly low prices
- Session opening prices where early sellers entered

When price reaches SSL, smart money BUYS INTO this liquidity (buys from the sellers/longs). This creates a temporary SPIKE downward, then reversal upward.

**Key Insight**: Smart money's game is:
1. Move price toward liquidity pools (accumulating orders stacked there)
2. TRIGGER the stops (creating impact + volume)
3. ABSORB the liquidity (fill their own orders using that impact)
4. REVERSE price in intended direction (now with filled orders, move to next target)

Example on EURUSD:
- Longs have SLs at 1.0450 (swing low) = SSL zone
- Shorts have SLs at 1.0550 (swing high) = BSL zone
- Price at 1.0500 (middle)
- Smart money wants to go DOWN (bearish intent)
- They push price DOWN to 1.0450, hitting the long SLs (SSL)
- Longs panic-sell, liquidity absorbed
- Smart money now has large short position + absorbed longs' liquidity
- Price then falls hard toward 1.0400, 1.0350, etc.

**Liquidity Pool Identification Checklist**:
- [ ] Prior swing high/low (retail stops congregate here)
- [ ] Round number (1.0500, 1.1000, psychological zones)
- [ ] Weekly high/low (end-of-week levels that retail watches)
- [ ] Monthly high/low (end-of-month institutional targets)
- [ ] Session open price (Asia/London/NY opening levels)
- [ ] Fibonacci retracement levels (traders use Fib for SLs)
- [ ] Volume clusters (where lots of trading occurred)
- [ ] Order book concentration (L2 showing depth clusters)

### 1.2 Order Blocks - Complete Definition

**Order Block (OB)**: The LAST CANDLE BEFORE A DIRECTIONAL MOVE (displacement).

**Mechanism**:
1. Price consolidates or moves sideways
2. Institutions place large orders in a zone (this becomes the OB)
3. Price then moves AWAY from that zone rapidly (displacement)
4. The OB zone becomes support/resistance (price returns to fill these orders)

**Bullish Order Block Formation**:
- Prior candles: sideways or slightly down
- OB candle (last candle before move): buyers gather, accumulate, build position
- Post-OB: price explodes upward (displacement)
- The LOW of the OB candle (approximately) becomes support level
- When price retraces back to OB zone, it RESPECTS IT (bounces) before continuing up

**Bearish Order Block Formation**:
- Prior candles: sideways or slightly up
- OB candle: sellers gather, accumulate, prepare to short
- Post-OB: price explodes downward (displacement)
- The HIGH of the OB candle becomes resistance level
- When price retraces back to OB zone, it RESPECTS IT (bounces) before continuing down

**Refined OB Definition (Multiple Timeframes)**:
- Single timeframe OB: the single last candle (strong but limited)
- Double OB: last 2 candles both show accumulation before move (stronger)
- Triple OB: last 3 candles show institutional footprint (very strong)
- Use the wick + body to define boundaries, not just close prices

**Order Block Strength Factors**:
1. **Volume confirmation**: OB formed on HIGH VOLUME (institutions trading large size). Low volume = weak OB.
2. **Displacement power**: Larger the move AFTER the OB, the stronger the OB (more institutional conviction)
3. **Freshness**: Just formed OB stronger than OB formed 10 days ago (less tested = higher probability)
4. **Tested count**: Fresh OB (0 tests) = 85% probability respect. Tested once = 75%, twice = 60%, three times = 45% (declining probability each test)
5. **Multi-TF alignment**: OB on 1m + 5m + 15m + 1h = very strong. OB only on 1m = weak.
6. **Proximity to macro event**: OB formed during central bank news = stronger (more conviction)

**Order Block Entry Rules**:
- Enter when price APPROACHES the OB from the opposite direction
- Entry price: at the OB level or just inside (for safety)
- SL: beyond the OB boundary (if long, SL below OB low; if short, SL above OB high)
- TP: next liquidity zone or swing extreme
- Time to entry: within 5-15 candles of OB formation (after that, edge decays)
- Volume confirmation: confirm entry with volume spike (more buyers/sellers entering)

**Failed Order Block Invalidation**:
- If price breaks the OB definitively (close + next candle confirms), the OB is MITIGATED NEGATIVELY
- The failed OB zone now becomes support (if broke below) or resistance (if broke above)
- Mark trade as loss, move to next setup

### 1.3 Fair Value Gaps (FVG) - Complete Encyclopedia

**FVG Definition**: A three-candle formation creating an unfilled price gap. Price leaves a "gap" (void in the chart), and institutional traders know price MUST return to fill it.

**Bullish FVG Structure**:
- Candle 1: Strong bearish candle (down move)
- Candle 2: Bullish candle that continues DOWN initially, then reverses UP
  - IMPORTANT: Candle 2 opens BELOW the low of Candle 1 (creates gap)
  - But Candle 2 closes ABOVE the open of Candle 1
  - The gap is the area between Candle 1 close and Candle 2 open (below candle 2 opens)
- Candle 3: Bearish candle that reverses down, closing below candle 2
  - BUT does NOT fill the gap (doesn't go as low as candle 2 open)
  - Gap remains unfilled

The unfilled gap zone is the FVG. Price will eventually return and fill it.

**Bearish FVG Structure** (inverse):
- Candle 1: Strong bullish candle (up move)
- Candle 2: Bearish candle that reverses and closes down
  - Opens ABOVE the high of Candle 1
  - Closes BELOW the open of Candle 1
  - Gap created above
- Candle 3: Bullish candle but closes below candle 2, doesn't fill the gap
  - Gap remains unfilled

**FVG Timing**:
- FVGs on 1-minute charts: filled usually within 1-4 hours
- FVGs on 5-minute charts: filled within 4-24 hours
- FVGs on 15-minute charts: filled within 1-5 days
- FVGs on 1-hour charts: filled within 5-20 days
- FVGs on daily charts: filled within 1-3 months (very reliable when filled)

**FVG Entry Strategy**:
1. Identify FVG on chart (mark zone)
2. Wait for price to approach FVG from opposite side
3. When price enters FVG zone, it's "attracted" to fill it
4. Entry: LIMIT order at edge of FVG (buy at FVG low if bullish, sell at FVG high if bearish)
5. SL: beyond FVG zone (tight, as price is already in gap)
6. TP: price fills gap and continues in direction of trend post-fill

**FVG Confluence with Other Factors**:
- FVG + Order Block = very strong (OB contains FVG) = high-grade signal
- FVG + Support/resistance = strong
- FVG + Volume spike confirmation = strong
- FVG alone (no other confluence) = moderate (lower grade)

### 1.4 Break of Structure (BOS) - Complete Mechanics

**BOS Definition**: Price moves BEYOND a recent swing extreme (high or low) and **CLOSES** beyond it with conviction.

NOT just a wick—the close must be beyond the level.

**Bullish BOS**:
- Recent swing low (LL - lower low) is the reference point
- Price breaks ABOVE the prior swing low with force
- Candle CLOSES above the swing low (not just a wick)
- Followed by another candle that CONFIRMS by also closing above swing low
- Pattern now: LL, then BOS above LL = structure change upward = bullish

**Bearish BOS**:
- Recent swing high (HH - higher high) is the reference point
- Price breaks BELOW the prior swing high with force
- Candle CLOSES below the swing high
- Followed by confirmation
- Pattern now: HH, then BOS below HH = structure change downward = bearish

**BOS Strength Indicators**:
1. **Volume on BOS candle**: High volume = strong BOS. Low volume = weak (likely to fail).
2. **Displacement after BOS**: Fast move away from broken level = strong. Slow move = weak.
3. **Multiple TF BOS**: 1m BOS + 5m BOS + 15m BOS simultaneously = very strong BOS.
4. **Time to retest**: If price retests BOS level quickly, higher probability BOS holds (institutions backing it).

**Failed BOS**:
- BOS occurs but price reverses before displacement
- Example: BOS below swing high, but price bounces back above swing high without moving down further
- Failed BOS = fake signal = skip trade, wait for next setup

**BOS Entry Strategy**:
1. Identify swing extreme (HH or LL)
2. Wait for BOS (close beyond level)
3. Wait for confirmation candle (next candle also in direction of BOS)
4. Enter: on close of confirmation candle OR on pullback toward BOS level (retest)
5. SL: beyond opposite extreme (if BOS down, SL above prior HH)
6. TP: next major structure level (next swing high for BOS down, next swing low for BOS up)

### 1.5 Change of Character (CHoCH) - Complete Analysis

**CHoCH Definition**: A SHIFT IN THE RATE & NATURE of price movement. Not just a one-candle move, but a CHANGE in the pattern of price behavior.

**Example**:
- Last 10 candles: HH + HL (bullish, gradual climb, slow gains)
- CHoCH occurs: suddenly print LH (lower high), then LL (lower low)
- The "character" of price movement changed from slow bull to fast bear

**Bullish to Bearish CHoCH**:
- Prior 3-5 candles: HH + HL (uptrend character)
- CHoCH candles: Print lower highs + lower lows within 1-2 candles
- Interpretation: bullish momentum faded; bearish momentum emerging
- Confirmation: next 2-3 candles continue with LL pattern
- Action: downtrend now likely; consider shorts or stop longs

**Bearish to Bullish CHoCH**:
- Prior 3-5 candles: LL + LH (downtrend character)
- CHoCH candles: Print higher lows + higher highs within 1-2 candles
- Interpretation: bearish momentum faded; bullish momentum emerging
- Confirmation: next 2-3 candles continue with HH pattern
- Action: uptrend likely; consider longs or stop shorts

**CHoCH Strength**:
- Fast CHoCH (happens in 1-2 candles) = strong conviction
- Slow CHoCH (gradual over 5+ candles) = less conviction
- Volume on CHoCH candle = confirmation
- Multi-TF CHoCH = very strong (CHoCH on 1m + 5m + 15m)

**Combined CHoCH + BOS**:
- BOS confirms a CHoCH
- CHoCH + BOS = very high probability trend reversal
- Example: LH + LL (CHoCH) + price breaks below prior LL (BOS) = strong downtrend entry

### 1.6 SMT Divergence (Smart Money Tactics with Multiple Instruments)

**SMT Definition**: When two or more CORRELATED instruments show DIVERGENCE in price action, it reveals smart money's true intent.

**Correlation Relationships**:
- EURUSD vs GBPUSD: highly correlated (both vs USD) → correlation ~0.85
- EURUSD vs USDJPY: negatively correlated (both have USD) → correlation ~-0.65
- XAUUSD vs USD pairs: inversely correlated (gold inversely relates to USD strength)
- XAUUSD vs XAUEUR: gold in different currency bases → when diverge, one forex pair is moving

**Divergence Detection**:
When two normally-correlated pairs move in opposite directions:
- EURUSD up 1%, but GBPUSD down 0.5% = divergence
- XAUUSD up 50 pips, but XAUEUR down 30 pips = divergence

**Smart Money Interpretation**:
When divergence occurs, smart money is likely:
1. **Distributing in the stronger pair** (taking profits in the pair that moved more)
2. **Accumulating in the weaker pair** (buying weakness for later reversal)
3. **Stopping out retail traders** in the weaker pair (stop hunts)

**Divergence Strategy**:
1. Monitor two correlated pairs simultaneously
2. When divergence emerges (one up, one down), identify the weaker pair
3. FADE the move (trade against) in the weaker pair
4. Example:
   - EURUSD rallies to 1.0550 (+50 pips)
   - GBPUSD only to 1.2900 (+20 pips)
   - Divergence: EUR stronger
   - Trade: SHORT GBPUSD expecting it to catch down (buy GBP at weak levels)
5. Enter on pullback; SL if divergence closes; TP at prior level or below

**Cross-Asset SMT** (Your XAUUSD/XAUEUR Example):
- XAUUSD sweeps up to 2045 (above liquidity)
- XAUEUR simultaneously sweeps to equivalent EUR level
- Both pairs respect same level (in their respective terms)
- Interpretation: BOTH longs got stopped out (coordinated liquidity grab)
- Smart money: now long from swept zone with tight SL
- Entry: buy both pairs near swept level expecting reversal

## MODULE 2: COMPLETE CANDLESTICK PATTERN ENCYCLOPEDIA

### 2.1 Single Candlestick Patterns

**1. Hammer Pattern**
- Structure: Small body at top, long lower wick, minimal upper wick
- Size ratio: Body 1/3 of range, wick 2/3 of range
- Context: Appears at bottom of downtrend (support zone)
- Psychology: Sellers pushed price down (wick), but buyers stepped in and recovered (body close high). Reversal potential.
- Entry rule: Buy if hammer + demand zone + prior downtrend. SL below wick. TP at prior swing high.
- Grade contribution: Grade boost from D→C if at demand zone. Grade boost C→B if + order block.

**2. Hanging Man Pattern**
- Structure: Looks like hammer BUT appears at TOP of uptrend
- Context: At resistance zone after uptrend
- Psychology: Buyers pushed up, but sellers pushed back. Reversal risk.
- Entry rule: Short if hanging man + supply zone + prior uptrend. SL above wick. TP at prior swing low.
- Confirmation: Next candle closes near hanging man's body or lower = bearish confirmation.

**3. Doji Pattern**
- Structure: Open = Close (or very close). Long wicks on both sides.
- Interpretation: Indecision. Neither buyers nor sellers won. Market in balance.
- Alone: Weak signal (grade D). Combined with structure: stronger.
- Doji + order block + volume spike = grade upgrade to B-C.

**4. Spinning Top Pattern**
- Structure: Small body (similar size to doji), wicks above and below.
- Context: Often appears during consolidation.
- Interpretation: Low momentum candle. Indecision. Often precedes volatility expansion.
- Entry rule: Use as a WARNING of expansion coming. Don't enter on spinning top alone.

**5. Marubozu Pattern**
- Structure: Large body with minimal/no wicks
- Types: Bullish marubozu (open=low, close=high), Bearish marubozu (open=high, close=low)
- Psychology: Strong directional conviction. Buyers/sellers won decisively.
- Entry rule: Bullish marubozu in uptrend = continuation signal. Bearish marubozu in downtrend = continuation. Marubozu against trend = potential exhaustion.
- Grade boost: Marubozu at order block + on breakout = strong signal (grade boost).

**6. Inverted Hammer / Shooting Star Pattern**
- Structure: Long upper wick, small body at bottom, minimal lower wick (inverse hammer)
- Context: Inverted hammer at support (bullish reversal potential); Shooting star at resistance (bearish reversal potential)
- Entry rule: Similar to hammer logic but opposite direction.

### 2.2 Two-Candle Patterns

**1. Bullish Engulfing**
- Structure: Candle 1 (small bearish body), Candle 2 (large bullish body that completely engulfs Candle 1)
- Context: At bottom of downtrend (support/demand zone)
- Psychology: Sellers pushed down (candle 1), buyers overwhelmed them (candle 2 completely covers candle 1). Reversal.
- Entry rule: Buy on close of candle 2 or next pullback. SL below candle 1 low. TP at prior swing high.
- Volume confirmation: MUST have volume on candle 2 > candle 1 volume (usually 1.5x+) to be valid.
- Grade boost: Engulfing + demand zone + RSI oversold + volume spike = grade A-S.

**2. Bearish Engulfing**
- Structure: Candle 1 (small bullish), Candle 2 (large bearish engulfing candle 1)
- Context: At top of uptrend (resistance/supply zone)
- Entry rule: Short on close of candle 2 or on pullback. SL above candle 1 high.
- Volume confirmation: Same as bullish (volume > prior candle).

**3. Bullish Harami**
- Structure: Candle 1 (large bearish body), Candle 2 (small bullish body INSIDE candle 1 range)
- Context: At support/demand zone
- Psychology: Buyers gained ground (candle 2 bullish) but not enough to reverse fully. Indecision turning bullish.
- Entry rule: Wait for confirmation. Don't trade harami alone. Harami + FVG or order block = stronger.
- Weakness: Harami can also be false reversal bait (fake setup).

**4. Bearish Harami**
- Structure: Candle 1 (large bullish), Candle 2 (small bearish inside candle 1)
- Context: At resistance/supply zone

**5. Tweezer Tops Pattern**
- Structure: Two candles with approximately EQUAL HIGHS (wick or close levels roughly equal)
- Context: At top of uptrend
- Psychology: Price failed twice at same level. Reversal potential.
- Entry rule: Short below both tweezer lows. SL above both tweezers. TP at prior swing low.
- Strength: Tweezer at supply zone + RSI overbought = good signal.

**6. Tweezer Bottoms Pattern**
- Structure: Two candles with approximately EQUAL LOWS
- Context: At bottom of downtrend
- Entry rule: Buy above both tweezers. SL below both tweezers.

- Candle 2: Small body (reversal candle, shows indecision)
- Candle 3: Large bullish body closing above the midpoint of Candle 1
- Context: At bottom of downtrend (demand zone)
- Psychology: Sellers strong (candle 1), then sellers weak (candle 2), then buyers strong (candle 3). Clear reversal.
- Entry rule: Buy on close of candle 3 or next pullback. SL below candle 1 low. TP at prior swing high.
- Strength: Morning star + demand zone + RSI oversold + volume = grade A-S.
- Success rate: ~68% when identified correctly at demand zones.

**2. Evening Star Pattern (Bearish Reversal)**
- Candle 1: Large bullish body
- Candle 2: Small reversal candle
- Candle 3: Large bearish body closing below midpoint of Candle 1

**3. Three White Soldiers Pattern**
- Structure: Three consecutive BULLISH candles, each opening above prior candle's close
- Context: Mid-uptrend or after bullish reversal
- Psychology: Three straight days of buyer control. Strong continuation.
- Entry rule: If uptrend context + order block, buy on close of third candle. TP further up.
- Weakness: Can be fake if fourth candle reverses (false breakout).

**4. Three Black Crows Pattern**
- Structure: Three consecutive BEARISH candles, each opening below prior candle's close
- Context: Mid-downtrend or after bearish reversal
- Entry rule: Short with downtrend context. TP further down.

**5. Piercing Line Pattern**
- Candle 1: Bearish (downtrend)
- Candle 2: Bullish opening below candle 1 low, closing above candle 1 midpoint
- Context: At support/demand zone
- Psychology: Sellers pushed down (candle 1 open), but buyers fought back (candle 2 close). Bullish reversal partial.
- Entry rule: Less reliable than morning star. Use as confirmation with other factors.

**6. Dark Cloud Cover Pattern**
- Candle 1: Bullish (uptrend)
- Candle 2: Bearish opening above candle 1 high, closing below candle 1 midpoint
- Context: At resistance/supply zone
- Psychology: Sellers overwhelm buyers. Bearish reversal.
- Entry rule: Short when confirmed by structure/volume.

- Entry rule: 
  - SHORT when price breaks below neckline with volume
  - SL: above right shoulder high (or head high for aggressive)
  - TP: measure from head to neckline, project downward from neckline break
- Success rate: 70%+ when identified correctly
- Confluence: Head & shoulders + supply zone + macro bearish = grade A-S

**2. Inverse Head and Shoulders (Bullish Reversal)**
- Structure: Left shoulder (trough), Head (lower trough), Right shoulder (trough higher than head)

- Grade boost: Double top + supply zone + bearish macro = strong signal

**4. Double Bottom Pattern (Bullish Reversal)**
- Structure: Two troughs at similar level, separated by bounce
- Context: At bottom of downtrend
- Entry rule: BUY above the bounce level (resistance between troughs). SL below both troughs.
- Success rate: 68%+

**5. Triple Top Pattern (Strong Bearish Reversal)**
- Structure: Three peaks at approximately same level (very tight, within 2-5 pips of each other)
- Context: At top of extended uptrend
- Psychology: Price failed THREE TIMES to break higher. Strong exhaustion signal. Reversal very likely.
- Entry rule:
  - SHORT below support level between tops
  - Volume should spike on breakdown
  - SL: above all three tops
  - TP: measure distance to support, project downward
- Success rate: 70%+
- Stronger than double top due to THREE tests of resistance

- Entry rule: BUY above resistance between bottoms.
- Success rate: 70%+

**7. Rounding Top Pattern (Bearish Reversal)**
- Structure: Price gradually forms a curved / rounded top (like a hill)

  - Cup: Large rounded dip (like a cup shape)
  - Handle: Tight consolidation after cup recovery, forming small flag/pullback
- Context: Mid-uptrend (not at top, but in middle of longer trend)
- Psychology: Consolidation after bounce from demand zone; setup for next leg up
- Entry rule:
  - BUY when price breaks above handle resistance
  - SL: below handle low
  - TP: measure cup height, project upward from handle breakout
- Success rate: 65-70% continuation rate
- Grade boost: Cup & handle + order block + volume = strong signal

**10. Inverse Cup and Handle Pattern (Bearish Continuation)**
- Structure: Rounded high + small consolidation (handle)
- Entry rule: SHORT break of handle support. TP projects downward.

---

### 2.5 Continuation Patterns

**1. Flag Pattern (Bullish & Bearish)**
- Structure: 
  - Pole: Sharp move (up for bullish flag, down for bearish)
  - Flag: Rectangular consolidation AGAINST the trend (slightly downward for bullish flag)
  - Trendlines: Two parallel lines sloping against the trend
- Psychology: Sharp move followed by profit-taking (consolidation), then resumption of trend
- Volume: High on pole, lower on flag, spike on breakout
- Entry rule:
  - Bullish flag: BUY break above flag's upper trendline, SL below lower trendline
  - Bearish flag: SHORT break below flag's lower trendline
  - TP: pole height, projected from flag breakout
- Success rate: 65-70%
- Time to breakout: Usually within 5-20 candles of flag formation

**2. Pennant Pattern**
- Structure: Similar to flag but smaller and more triangular (converging trendlines)
- Formation time: 1-3 weeks typically
- Entry rule: Break of pennant with volume. TP = pole height projected forward.
- Difference from triangle: Pennant is SMALLER and forms FASTER

**3. Triangle Patterns**
- **Symmetrical Triangle**:
  - Structure: Converging trendlines from both top and bottom (pyramid shape)
  - Volatility: Decreasing; low volume inside triangle, spike on breakout
  - Direction: Can break either way; not predictive of direction
  - Entry rule: Break either side with volume; SL on opposite side; TP = base of triangle
  - Success rate: Slightly better for continuation than reversal
  
- **Ascending Triangle**:
  - Structure: Horizontal resistance (flat top), rising support (trendline slopes up)
  - Psychology: Buyers pushing higher lows; resistance holding. Bullish bias.
  - Entry rule: BUY break above horizontal resistance, SL below ascending support line
  - Success rate: 70%+ for upside breakout (bullish bias confirmed)
  
- **Descending Triangle**:
  - Structure: Horizontal support (flat bottom), falling resistance (slopes down)
  - Psychology: Sellers pushing lower highs; support holding. Bearish bias.
  - Entry rule: SHORT break below horizontal support, SL above descending resistance
  - Success rate: 70%+ for downside breakout

**4. Wedge Patterns**
- **Rising Wedge** (Typically Bearish):
  - Structure: Both highs and lows moving higher, but highs rising slower than lows (converging, sloping up)
  - Psychology: Uptrend momentum FADING. Each bounce slightly weaker. Reversal coming.
  - Entry rule: SHORT break below lower trendline, SL above upper trendline
  - Success rate: 70%+ for downside breakout
  - Confirmation: Rising wedge + supply zone + macro bearish = strong short setup
  
- **Falling Wedge** (Typically Bullish):
  - Structure: Both lows and highs moving lower, but lows falling faster than highs (converging, sloping down)
  - Psychology: Downtrend momentum FADING. Each drop slightly weaker. Reversal coming.
  - Entry rule: BUY break above upper trendline, SL below lower trendline
  - Success rate: 70%+ for upside breakout
  - Confirmation: Falling wedge + demand zone + macro bullish = strong long setup

**5. Rectangle Pattern**
- Structure: Horizontal support and resistance (sideways movement between two levels)
- Psychology: Range-bound consolidation. Neither buyers nor sellers in control.
- Entry rule:
  - Range traders: BUY near support, SELL near resistance (multiple entries)
  - Breakout traders: Breakthrough either side with volume
  - SL: opposite side of rectangle
- Success rate: Depends on breakout direction; rectangle doesn't predict direction

### 2.6 Pattern Confluence Grading Rules

Pattern alone = Grade C-D (weak, skip)
Pattern + demand/supply zone = Grade C-B (better, consider)
Pattern + order block = Grade B-A (strong, trade if risk-reward good)
Pattern + order block + FVG = Grade B-A (very strong)
Pattern + order block + FVG + volume spike + multi-TF alignment = Grade A-S (elite)
