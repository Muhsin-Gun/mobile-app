Place your app images in this folder (e.g. `logo.png`).

Notes:
- Keep filenames lowercase and use underscores (e.g. `app_logo.png`).
- For resolution variants create `2.0x/` or `3.0x/` subfolders containing the same filenames.
- After adding images run `flutter pub get` and restart the app (hot restart) to see the change.
